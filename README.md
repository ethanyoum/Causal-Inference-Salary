This project investigates whether working remotely affects salaries in the U.S. data industry—and whether the impact differs between Data Analysts and Data Engineers. Using a dataset of U.S.-based tech employees from 2020–2023, we examined salary trends before and after the 2023 “workforce stabilization,” when many companies scaled back remote work.

This analysis applied causal inference techniques such as Propensity Score Matching, Difference-in-Differences, and Synthetic DiD to control for confounding factors (e.g., experience level, company size, job location). The results show that:

* Data Analysts working remotely faced a sharp salary decline of nearly 9% post-2023.

* Data Engineers saw only a minor reduction (~1.4%), suggesting their work is less penalized by remote arrangements.

* Experience level significantly influences salary estimates—ignoring it overstates the effect of remote work by about $626 per year.

These findings reveal that remote work’s salary impact is highly role-dependent. Employers and policymakers should consider these differences when designing compensation structures to avoid disproportionately disadvantaging certain roles.
